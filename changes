LOGIC
- Create a method that checks if the mouse is over each button
- Create a method (or methods) that can level up / manage each store
- Create a method that calculates the rate of income
- Remove the current system for managing selected stores (currently very intensive)
- Create an 'ai' for the people that walk around the store

- Once the game is optimized with the above features, add additional levels (yikes!)

GRAPHICS
- Create a general graphic that appears over each store if the mouse is over it and you can purchase it
- Make the balance counter smoother (it is too fast especially when the rate is large)
- Add people that aimlessly walk around the mall (and visit the stores?)
- Make the stores clickable (with additional income)
- Add a subtraction (to the balance) notice and an additional (to the rate) notice when you upgrade a shop

PAINFUL
- Make the game adaptable to mobile devices (yikes!)
