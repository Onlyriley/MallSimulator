LOGIC
- Change the way the people walking around is handled (Maybe threading ?)
- Reorganize the whole thing, the code is getting pretty gross

GRAPHICS
- Make the stores clickable (with additional income)
- Add a subtraction (to the balance) notice and an additional (to the rate) notice when you upgrade a shop

PAINFUL
- Make the game adaptable to mobile devices (yikes!)
