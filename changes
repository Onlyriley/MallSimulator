LOGIC
- Create an 'ai' for the people that walk around the store
- Add 'positions' for coordinates rather than manually entering the x and y values for everything
- Once the game is optimized with the above features, add additional levels (yikes!)

GRAPHICS
- Add people that aimlessly walk around the mall (and visit the stores?)
- Make the stores clickable (with additional income)
- Add a subtraction (to the balance) notice and an additional (to the rate) notice when you upgrade a shop

PAINFUL
- Make the game adaptable to mobile devices (yikes!)
